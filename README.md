# My_Voxel_Terrain (UNITY)

This is used to generate a terrain made up of manipulatable voxels. 

This is the first part of a greater project to create a voxel world where I can bring to life my creations (3D models, 2D art, AI, etc.) 

At present, the only part that will be made up of manipulatable voxels, will be the terrain.
