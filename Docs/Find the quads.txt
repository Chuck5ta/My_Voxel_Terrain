FORMING A QUAD - what needs to be checked


Are we looking to form more than 1 quad?



NEED TO FIND THE QUADS IN A 3D ARRAY!!!
=======================================
then we can subdivide forever


Initialise all 3D array locations to null

only process 3D locations that are not null

Process order 
Bottom

X, Y, Z

X row at a time

BOTTOM of planet DECISION - ALL OF PLANET?????
can't skip a row this time, as we need to see if a quad will form in many qirections
- on the current level
- and/or joining the current level with the level above


X0, Y0, Z0

IS THERE A QUAD TO BE MADE ALONG THE X AXIS?


IS THERE A QUAD TO BE MADE ALONG THE Y AXIS? do we check above and below? I reckon just above!


IF CURRENT VERTEX IS NOT NULL (quad to be made somewhere)
    IS THERE A QUAD TO BE MADE ALONG THE X AXIS?
	// at same level - horizontal plane
	IF (X + 1, Y, Z) !NULL && (X + 1, Y, Z + 1) !NULL && (X, Y, Z + 1) !NULL
		GenerateQuadAt the above location
	// crossing levels - vertical plane
	IF (X + 1, Y, Z) !NULL && (X, Y + 1, Z) !NULL && (X + 1, Y + 1, Z) !NULL
		GenerateQuadAt the above location

NEED TO TEST ALL POSSIBLE DIRECTIONS!!!!!
flat
crossing 
X+1 Y+1 Z
X-1 Y-1 Z
X+1 Y-1 Z
X-1 Y+1 Z
X Y Y+1 Z+1
X Y Y+1 Z-1
X Y Y-1 Z+1
X Y Y-1 Z-1
Directly above
X Y+1 Z


ELSE IS THERE A QUAD TO BE MADE ALONG THE Y AXIS?
